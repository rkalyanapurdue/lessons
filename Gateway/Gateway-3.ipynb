The method is called the normalized difference vegetation index **(NDVI)**. We can use NDVI to examine the rainforest before and after the devastating fires.\n"

    "NDVI uses two spectral bands of satellite imagery--the **Near Infrared (NIR)** and **Red (R)** bands--to find the reflectance from live plants. Spectral bands capture reflected wavelengths along the electromagnetic spectrum (think colors of the rainbow and more). NDVI is \"ratio of the difference of the red and infrared radiances over their sum\" ([Wikipedia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_difference_vegetation_index)). \n",
