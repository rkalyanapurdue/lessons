    "Another way to think about database is through the lens of a computer. A computer is a device that allows you to manipulate data which is commonly in the form of text, numbers, images, and videos. However to do these manipulations the computer needs to *store* the data before it can be referenced or changed. Apart from storing information it needs to also make sure that the right information is provided at the right time. This is where the database truly shines. Not only does it helps to store and update data, but it also helps to retrieve data efficiently and seamlessly. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can consider a database as a **giant filing cabinet**. It can store vast amounts of information that you can easily refer to. Or you can even think of adatabase as a **phone book**. Phone books are used to organize data (names, addresses, and phone numbers) using a unique identifying characteristic (a person's name) to align data. To find information, you’d search the phone book for this unique identifier. Similarly, database helps to organize data, and helps in efficient retrieval with the help of unique identifiers (called keys in database). The difference is that while the phone book is restricted to store only text and numbers, the database can store many more types of data.  \n",
